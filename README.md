**AI Assistant & Predictive Analytics in Python**  
Developed an interactive AI assistant on Google Colab capable of web search, hotel booking predictions, student placement and salary predictions, and weather forecasting. Applied **machine learning, NLP, web scraping, and data preprocessing** to deliver accurate, real-time predictions and responses.  
**Tools & Frameworks:** Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, NLTK, BeautifulSoup, Google Colab.  
**Concepts:** Machine learning, regression, classification, TF-IDF similarity, chatbots, predictive modeling, interactive user interfaces.


# ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **multi-functional AI assistant** in Python using Google Colab, capable of:

1. **Web search and information extraction** via Google Search, BeautifulSoup, and TF-IDF similarity ranking.
2. **Hotel reservation prediction** using logistic regression based on historical booking data.
3. **Placement and salary prediction** for students using logistic and linear regression models.
4. **Weather prediction** using KNN, SVM, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
5. **Interactive chat interface** using NLTK chat utilities.

The project is modular, leveraging machine learning, web scraping, and natural language processing to respond to diverse user queries.
